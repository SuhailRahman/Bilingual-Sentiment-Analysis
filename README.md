# Bilingual-Sentiment-Analysis
The main aim of the project is to develop a sentiment analyzer that can be used on twitter data to classify it as positive or negative. Our project takes care of the challenge of bilingual comments, where people tweet in two languages, in this case Hindi and English, in the Latin Alphabet.
